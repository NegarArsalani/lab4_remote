            <p>My name is Negar but I go with Noora since Negar is a rather peculiar name.
                I turned 18 last july and I can officially say I'm an adult now.<strong>An adult!</strong> it still
                sounds unbelievable.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Iran; I'm currenty in Iran as well spending some quality time with my parents
                and attending BCIT online, studying CIT.</p>
            <p>To talk about my passions and things that I enjoy, I like reading, watching movies,
                getting food with my friends and as people would argue,
                the most outstanding aspect of my personality is that I'm a cat person. I <em>love</em> cats. Couldn't
                even put it into words how much
                joy petting a kitten brings me. I also am an introvert but I try really hard to socialize.</p>
